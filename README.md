Natural Language Processing using Python


Here is a Repo that covers most parts of NLP.

Major project: GPT2 style Text Generator I have used my All time favourite Novel by Sir Aurthor Conan Doyle - "The Hour of Baskervills".

To test it, just run the HoB.py file using the command python3 HoB.py in Ubuntu/Linux Distor. Python HoB.py on Windows/Mac.

Before you try it, ensure you have Keras installed on your machine.


If you'd like to try the text classification please feel free to use your own dataset or download the dataset that I have worked on from Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews
